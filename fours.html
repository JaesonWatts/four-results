<p>Each of the nine types of the Enneagram has its own driving force, which is centered around a particular emotion. Some types experience strong emotions, while other types aim to avoid emotions in one form or another. However, whether running from emotions or diving into them, each type describes some aspect of emotional experience.</p>
<p>The nine types of the Enneagram are commonly divided into three groups of three types each: Body Types, Head Types, and Heart Types. Each of these groups is considered to be driven by a particular center of intelligence and a particular core emotion.</p>
<h3>Body Types</h3>
<p>Body types are driven by instinct and are tuned into their five senses as a primary means of gathering information. Body types often feel their emotions and reactions in their stomach and have a "gut sense" for things.</p>
<p>For body types, the core emotion is <strong>anger</strong>. This does not necessarily mean that all body types experience anger frequently. Some people who are body types repress their anger; however, it is still a driving force in their thoughts and actions.</p>

<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">Eight | 48% Match</p>
<p>Eights see themselves as strong and powerful and seek to stand up for what they believe in. They rarely see themselves as having vulnerabilities and have the belief that they can handle pretty much anything that comes their way. Eights have easy access to their anger, and as a result, are sometimes seen as intimidating to others. However, Eights typically see themselves as fighters, standing up for what is right and protecting the weak.</p>
<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">Nine | 70% Match</p>
<p>Nines are defined by a desire to live in peaceful harmony with their environment. They want a sense of balance and calm, and aspire to a kind of homeostasis where nothing disturbs their inner peace. They tend to be easygoing and accepting of what is happening around them, but can become resistant and willfully oblivious when something in the environment threatens to throw them off balance.</p>
<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">One | 68% Match</p>
<p>Ones are defined by their belief that everything must be in order, and by their feeling that they must always be "right." They show great commitment and determination to improve conditions that they find need improvement, and they are forward in encouraging others to improve their performance, too. </p>
<h3>Head Types</h3>
<p>Head types are driven by intellect and tend to analyze and rationalize their emotions. Head types make choices and evaluations based on their logical analysis and interpretations of things. They are prone to "overthinking" things.</p>
<p>For head types, the core emotion is <strong>fear</strong>. This does not necessarily mean that all head types knowingly experience a lot of fear; for some, fear is more of an unconscious driving force. </p>

<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">Five | 79% Match</p>
<p>Fives are driven by a belief that their resources are scarce, and that they don’t have enough of what they need. Unlike other types who go out into the world to get what they need, Fives instead aim to need as little as possible. To achieve this, they withdraw from the world, retreating into their minds to conserve their time, energy and other resources. </p>
<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">Six | 81% Match</p>
<p>Sixes are preoccupied with security, seek safety, and like to be prepared for problems. They have active minds which are constantly scanning for danger and creating contingency plans.

They are good at seeing how things will play out, particularly understanding how things could go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">Seven | 55% Match</p>
<p>Sevens are defined by their desire to experience everything good and pleasurable that the world has to offer, while avoiding pain, boredom, and limitations. Although Sevens appear enthusiastic and fun-loving, deep down, they have a fear of getting stuck in negative emotions. Thus, they tend to disconnect from their deeper feelings, instead focusing on their imagination and zest for life to keep them moving forward and gathering new, pleasurable experiences.</p>
<h3>Heart Types</h3>
<p>Heart types are driven by their emotions and their desire to connect with other people. Heart types are driven by a strong sense of empathy and their sense of what people are experiencing, both themselves and others. </p>
<p>For heart types, the core emotion is <strong>sadness</strong>, which originates from a sense of disconnection with self or others. Some heart types experience sadness more acutely, while others proactively try to connect with people to circumvent their core sadness.</p>

<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">Three | 50% Match</p>
<p>Threes are defined by their desire to achieve.

They have a burning need to be admired and see life as a game where winning is emphasized.</p>
<p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 18px;">Four | 98% Match</p>

<p> </p></div>      <div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-type_four test-result-dimension-type_profile_full"><h2>Your Type in Depth</h2>

<p>Your primary type is <strong>Four</strong>. In this section, we'll dive deep into the Four profile to understand how
    it drives your core emotions, fears, and desires, as well as how it impacts you in relationships and at work.</p>

<h3>In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>Fours are defined by their belief that they are different from other people, and by their feelings of envy for what
    others have. Fours have the sense that something is missing from their lives, and they worry that they will never
    have the happiness that other people experience.</p>

<p>At their core, Fours feel they are fundamentally flawed and will never be able to be truly understood by other
    people. At the same time, they passionately long for the type of deep connection that will make them feel whole and
    accepted. Many Fours romanticize and idealize their relationships, hoping that each new connection will be the one
    that finally makes them feel understood and appreciated.</p>

<p>Although Fours experience sadness over their separation from others, they also value their own uniqueness. They see
    themselves as special and want to express their individualism. Being different from other people is a double-edged
    sword for Fours: both a badge of honor, as well as a source of suffering.</p>

<h3>Core Weakness</h3>

<p><strong>Envy</strong>: believing others have something that you don’t.</p>

<p>Fours are driven by a sense that what is good and desirable is external to them, and that they are somehow deficient.
    Envy arises from the Four’s belief that other people have attained some happiness or satisfaction that is
    inaccessible to the Four.</p>

<h3>Core Belief</h3>

<p>“I am different and misunderstood.”</p>

<h3>Core Fear</h3>

<p>Being ordinary, unspecial, or insignificant. Living a mundane or unimportant life. Being abandoned or rejected
    because of some inherent flaw or deficiency.</p>

<p>Fours tend to feel sadness more readily than fear. In some way, the Four’s sadness is a way of preemptively
    experiencing their fears; instead of worrying about rejection, the Four grieves relationships as if they’ve already
    been rejected. Digging deeper into sadness and grief often reveals the core fears of the Four.</p>

<h3>Core Desire</h3>

<p>To find true understanding and an authentic and unique identity. To connect deeply with another special person who
    appreciates my uniqueness.</p>

<h3>Core Traits</h3>

<p><strong>Emotionality</strong>. Four are often singled out for their emotionality. They express a wide range of
    emotions, and are usually very aware of what is going on for them emotionally. Fours are not only emotional, but are
    emotionally driven; they find it very difficult to do anything if they are not “feeling it.” They can be sensitive
    to others’ feelings, as well, but for the Four, their own emotions are at the center of their universe.</p>

<p><strong>Seeking the Unattainable</strong>. Fours are predisposed to want what isn’t available. Fours’ core emotion of
    envy means that they are plagued by feelings that others have something which is missing from their own lives; the
    phrase “the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence” could be the personal slogan of the Four. Fours
    not only covet what others have, but tend to devalue anything that feels within their own reach. For the Four, what
    is attractive is unattainable, and what is attainable is unattractive.</p>

<p><strong>Feelings of Inadequacy</strong>. The Four’s susceptibility to envy relates to their own beliefs about
    themselves. Although they may not consciously realize it, Fours have a deep belief that what is good and worthwhile
    in the world is separate and inaccessible to them. They feel that who they are and what they have is unsatisfactory,
    and that other people are somehow better and more whole than they are. Their envy connects with this sense of deep
    inadequacy; they fear that on some level, they are unworthy and do not deserve to be happy.</p>

<p><strong>Melancholy</strong>. It is not surprising, then, that Fours often deploy their emotional awareness to dig
    into their sadness and isolation. Fours often do not understand why they feel so dissatisfied, and their natural
    tendency to introspection drives them to spend considerable time and energy reflecting on their failures and regrets
    in an effort to connect with their pain. In particular, Fours dwell on broken relationships, appreciating the
    bittersweet feeling of losing a person who was once deeply loved. They are inclined to focus on what is lost or
    missing, creating an atmosphere of never-ending grief.</p>

<p><strong>Artistic Sensibility</strong>. Although not all Fours are artists, Fours typically appreciate art as a means
    of self-expression. Even if they are not artistically inclined, Fours seek out creative ways to communicate their
    feelings, reactions, experiences, and identity.</p>

<h3>Emotional Life</h3>

<p>Of all the Enneagram types, Fours have the most active and intense emotional lives. They feel a wide range of
    emotions and feel them deeply. They are unafraid of emotional experience and expression, and are able to sit with
    difficult emotions (their own and others’) more readily than most people.</p>

<p>Fours have a sense of always being on the outside of the good life, always missing out on what’s important or
    satisfying. They feel that other people have access to some aspect of life that they themselves are shut out of.
    This causes feelings of disconnection as well as envy and jealousy. Fours are apt to covet what others have and
    assume that other people are happier, more connected, and more complete.</p>

<p>Fours are prone to sadness and even depression. Although Fours don’t necessarily enjoy being sad, they tend to feel
    that sadness is an emotion that should be fully experienced, rather than avoided or repressed. For healthy Fours,
    this means that they are aware of their sadness and take the time they need to process it. Unhealthy Fours, however,
    can tend to wallow in negative emotion until they become completely incapacitated by it.</p>

<p>Fours often feel wistful and melancholy. They tend to have bittersweet memories of the past and may even get a
    peculiar enjoyment out of remembering painful past relationships or circumstances. While some may see this as
    morbid, Fours feel that these experiences make up a significant and authentic part of who they are. They do not mind
    taking a stroll down memory lane, even when the road is rough.</p>

<p>When Fours feel upbeat and hopeful, it is often about some future possibility. They tend to feel excitement about new
    relationships or the possibility of fulfilling a dream. Fours’ idealism means that the reality of a dream, once
    actualized, is usually disappointing—but that doesn’t stop Fours from hoping that true satisfaction might be just
    around the bend.</p>

<h3>Childhood Origins</h3>

<p>In childhood, most Fours experienced a sense of loss or abandonment. This can be a profound loss, such as a death of
    a loved one, or something more subtle, like the loss of attention from parents when a younger sibling arrives. The
    Four’s characteristic envy has its origins in this early sense of something missing.</p>

<p>In relation to their families, Fours often feel like the black sheep or the outsider. They may not identify as being
    much like either parent, and tend to feel that the people closest to them don’t understand them very well at all.
    This feeling of being misunderstood creates distance between the Four and other people, which echoes into their
    relationships as adults.</p>

<p>The Four’s search for identity also originates in childhood. Because Fours grow up feeling like outsiders, they don’t
    readily take on the aspects of shared identity that might come from their families or communities. Rather, they feel
    they must search for and even invent their own unique identity. This search for belonging, and the sense of self
    that comes with it, is a lifelong occupation for Fours.</p>

<h3>In Relationships</h3>

<p>More so than any other type, Fours prize romantic love. They have an idealized view of relationships and tend to
    think in terms of “true love” or finding “the One.” Fours have a core belief that there is an ideal partner out
    there, somewhere, who will finally be able to provide them with true acceptance and understanding, thus redeeming
    all their struggles to belong.</p>

            <li>Often disappointed by reality</li>
            <li>Provoke partners when they feel neglected</li>
            <li>Want what they can’t have</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Because of their romantic nature, Fours can be exciting and provocative partners. They want a lot out of love, and
    they’re willing to put in the energy that requires. Fours don’t let their relationships slip into banality; they
    make sure that their connections stay vital and passionate. They want to know their partners deeply and engage with
    authentic emotion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reality of love tends to fall flat for Fours when compared with their romanticized idealism.
    Partners that the Four hoped would help them transcend their loneliness and self-doubt turn out to be human and
    flawed, just like everyone else. Fours tend to despair when they realize that a relationship has not transformed
    them in the way they had imagined it would, and they can become quite dramatic and even vicious in their
    disappointment.</p>

<p>Because of their idealism, Fours have a characteristic push-pull pattern in relationships. They romanticize people
    who are unattainable, imagining how wonderful and magical life would be if they were able to connect. But once a
    person is actually close enough to achieve real intimacy, the relationship loses its luster to the Four. The
    everyday realities of the relationship begin to seem mundane, even boring, and the Four wonders: “Is this all there
    is?” In particularly unhealthy patterns, Fours may cut things off with a person who they’ve grown disillusioned
    with, only to idealize and pursue them again once they’re at a distance—creating a perpetual cycle of longing and
    disappointment.</p>

<h3>At Work</h3>

<p>At work, Fours must have a sense that they are doing something original and unique to who they are. There is nothing
    worse to a Four than a sense that they are replaceable, or that they are simply a cog in a machine. A Four needs to
    feel that they are doing their work in a way nobody else can.</p>

<p><strong>What the Four needs at work:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Creative control</li>
    <li>Sense of being special&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Emotional connection to work</li>
    <li>Recognition for unique accomplishments</li>
</ul>

<p>Fours typically want complete creative control over their work. Although Fours are often described as artistic, and
    many are, even those Fours who do not consider themselves artists still need to exercise self-expression in what
    they do. Because Fours are so emotionally driven, they struggle in workplaces where they are expected to do things
    that do not feel authentic to them. Tasks that are overly prescriptive feel burdensome and demotivating to the
    Four.</p>

<p>At a deep level, Fours are motivated in their work by their desire for appreciation and recognition. Most Fours do
    not necessarily want to be seen as successful in conventional ways; they are far too individualistic to go after the
    award that everyone wants. However, they do want to be seen as special, and they want to make contributions that
    others cannot. Fours feel particularly satisfied when they have a sense that they are doing a job that they are
    uniquely qualified for, achieving results that others could not possibly replicate.</p>

<h3>The Spectrum of Health</h3>

<p>Like all types, Fours express their characteristics differently depending on how well they are functioning. When Fours are healthy, happy, and well-adapted, they will tend to display more of the positive qualities of their type. When they are less healthy and happy, they will show more of their characteristic weaknesses.</p>

<h4>Stressed</h4>

<p>When Fours are psychologically unhealthy, they are some of the most depressive and disconnected of all the types.
    Because they are very much in touch with their emotions, feelings of sadness and shame can consume them completely
    and render them unable to accomplish anything. Unhealthy Fours feel worthless and uniquely contemptible.</p>

<p>Stressed Fours can be described as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Listless</li>
    <li>Depressed</li>
    <li>Obsessive</li>
    <li>Self-loathing</li>
    <li>Hopeless</li>
    <li>Alienated</li>
    <li>Isolated</li>
    <li>Morbid</li>
    <li>Self-destructive</li>
</ul>

<h4>Average</h4>

<p>At average levels of psychological health, Fours seek to transcend everyday experience with fantasy and idealized
    visions. They get lost in their feelings and lose touch with the reality of the present. They feel disconnected and
    long for understanding.</p>

<p>Average Fours can be described as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Emotional</li>
    <li>Oversensitive</li>
    <li>Dramatic</li>
    <li>Self-absorbed</li>
    <li>Intense</li>
    <li>Moody</li>
    <li>Melancholy</li>
    <li>Envious</li>
    <li>Self-indulgent</li>
</ul>

<h4>Thriving</h4>

<p>At their best, Fours are emotionally deep, creatively expressive, and sensitive to the nuanced experiences of life.
    They are able to experience authentic, powerful emotional highs and lows, and to effectively channel these feelings
    into productive self-expression.</p>

<p>Thriving Fours can be described as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Self-aware</li>
    <li>Compassionate</li>
    <li>Introspective</li>
    <li>Intuitive</li>
    <li>Empathic</li>
    <li>Sensitive</li>
    <li>Idealistic</li>
    <li>Deep</li>
    <li>Creative</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transformations</h3>

<p>Essential to the Enneagram is the idea of growth and movement. Rather than being locked into a static personality
    type, the Enneagram shows how we can shift and change, both under stress and in times of expansion and growth. The
    two primary ways our personalities undergo transformation are through <strong>wings</strong> and
    <strong>arrows</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Wings</h4>

<p>In the Enneagram, each type is considered to have two potential wings. Your potential wings are the types which are
    adjacent to your primary type on the Enneagram diagram. For most people, their primary type explains the core of
    their behavior, while the wing drives secondary (and sometimes contradictory!) aspects of who they are. Learning
    about your wing will help you to understand your personality in more depth.</p>

<p>Wings are also a way to think about development. In studying the Enneagram, the first goal is always to understand
    ourselves as we are. The second goal is to understand how to move out of our patterns so that we may become more
    well-rounded, adaptable, and effective as people. Wings can help us to understand who we are, but they can also help
    us to see new behaviors that we might experiment with in order to grow and develop. Because our wings are adjacent
    to our own patterns, they can be easier to “try on” as compared with other, unrelated types.</p>

<p>As a Four, you may have either a Three or a Five wing, or a bit of both. These wings modify how you express your
    type, and add depth to understanding what drives you. If there are some aspects of who you are that do not seem to
    fit with your primary type, then understanding your wings may explain why.</p>

    </script>
  </div>
  </div>
</p>

<h5>The Three Wing</h5>

<p>Threes are achievement-oriented, competitive people who want to establish themselves as successful and accomplished
    in the eyes of others. At their core, Threes fear being worthless, and so they adopt a strategy of extreme
    productivity to prove their worth to the world.</p>

<p>A Three wing brings more productivity and achievement-oriented structure to the Four personality type. While Fours
    tend to shut down when they experience difficult emotions, Threes rarely let emotions get in the way of their goals.
    Developing a Three wing for Fours, then, can help them to tune into the possibility of focusing on results and
    effectiveness, and putting emotions aside when they are unproductive.</p>

<p>Developing a Three wing can also help Fours modulate their tendency toward self-centeredness. Fours’ emotional depth
    and need for authenticity can lead them to get quite wrapped up in their own issues, and they don’t mind distancing
    themselves from others if it means being true to themselves. In contrast, Threes want to present a desirable image
    to others, and do not mind putting their own needs and emotions aside for the sake of creating their public persona.
    Developing this image-conscious aspect of the Three can help the Four to better appreciate how they’re coming off to
    others—and when it might be appropriate to be a little less “real.”</p>

<p><strong>Contributions of a Three wing</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Results focus</li>
    <li>Productivity</li>
    <li>Conformity</li>
    <li>Use of social networks</li>
</ul>

<h5>The Five Wing</h5>

<p>Fives are detached, analytical people who want to understand the mechanics of the world and preserve their
    independence and personal space. At their core, they fear that the world will demand too much from them, and they
    defend against this by maintaining their distance from people and situations.</p>

<p>A Five wing brings more distance and emotional stability to the Four personality type. Where Fours can approach
    desperation in their desire to connect with other people, Fives are typically self-contained and wary about what
    relationships will demand from them. A Four with a Five wing, then, will desire authentic connection with others,
    but will be more cautious about how they approach relationships. This can help to moderate some of the emotional
    swings typical to the Four personality.</p>

<p>Developing a Five wing can also help Fours to be more objective. Fives are highly analytical and usually prefer to
    think about things rationally. While Fives certainly have emotions, they aren’t driven by them in the same way that
    Fours are. Fours with a Five wing are typically better positioned to consider situations objectively without letting
    their emotions take over. They make decisions more cautiously and less impulsively.</p>

<p><strong>Contributions of a Five wing</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Objectivity</li>
    <li>Distance</li>
    <li>Emotional control</li>
    <li>Rationality</li>
</ul>

<h4>Arrows</h4>

<p>Arrows in the Enneagram represent a path to development. Each Enneagram type is connected to two other types in the
    diagram, and each connection is marked with an arrow in a particular direction. These arrows can be thought of as
    pointing in the direction of growth. One arrow points towards your primary type, indicating that you must grow <em>from</em>
    this development point. The other arrow points away from your primary type, indicating that you will grow
    <em>toward</em> this development point.</p>

<p>In contrast with wings, which are somewhat related with our primary type, arrows point to aspects of our personality
    that may be completely neglected. We tend to access our arrow points during times of upheaval, when we are
    experiencing stress or profound personal growth. Accessing arrow points is often difficult and disruptive, but
    integrating these points with our personalities is an important part of becoming our highest selves.</p>

<p>Fours connect with development points of type One and Two. The characteristics of these types represent key
    developmental stages in the growth of the Four personality type. You may have already developed somewhat through
    your arrows, or you may find that your arrows present new opportunities for you to think about how to be more
    effective.</p>

<p>Your scores for each of your arrow points can give you some idea of how much you've already developed through these
    points. Higher scores indicate that you've already developed somewhat, while lower scores indicate an area for
    future growth.</p>

  </div>
</p>

<h5>Developing Through One</h5>

<p>The <strong>origin point</strong> of the Four is type One. This represents a mode that is blocked or repressed for
    the Four. For Fours, the origin point of One represents a repressed sense of objectivity. Fours tend to overfocus on
    how they feel about things as a way of evaluating the world. In contrast, Ones tend to believe that there is a
    single external value system that defines things as either correct or incorrect.</p>

<p>A key development point, then, is for the Four to rediscover the concept of an objective right and wrong and to
    consider in what circumstances this external values system might be more important or relevant than their own
    feelings about a particular matter.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks for development through the origin point</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify your principles.</strong> Instead of being guided by how you feel about things, spend some time
        exploring your beliefs about right and wrong. Practice asking, “what is the right thing to do?” rather than “how
        do I feel about this?”
    </li>
    <li><strong>Practice self-discipline.</strong> What would it be like to put your emotions aside and do what might be
        considered “correct,” apart from how you feel about it? Next time you have a chance to do something that you
        know is right, challenge yourself to set your feelings aside and take action.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Establish concrete goals.</strong> In contrast to Fours, who have a vague sense that what they do is
        never good enough, Ones keep a clear idea of what they want to achieve and work toward it. Next time you have a
        project to do, establish detailed, specific goals beforehand. Resolve to congratulate yourself on the
        achievement of those goals—no self-doubt or second-guessing allowed.
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Developing Through Two</h5>

<p>The <strong>growth point</strong> of the Four is type Two. This represents a mode that the Four can move towards as
    they seek to grow into new ways of being. For Fours who have developed their own characteristics into a healthy mode
    of being, discovering and adopting more of the healthy behaviors of Twos can open up their growth even further. This
    means discovering the sense of giving and belonging that are so natural to Twos.</p>

<p>Where Fours focus on themselves, feeling that they are apart and different from everyone else, Twos instinctively
    want to belong and proactively do things for others in order to do so. A Four can grow, then, by thinking less about
    their own needs and feelings and more about what they can do for other people. As the Four seeks to be useful and
    helpful to others, they often discover that being of service creates a new and much-appreciated sense of belonging
    to something larger.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks for development through the growth point</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Give others’ feelings as much attention as your own.</strong> While Fours are very emotionally aware,
        too often that awareness is focused inward. Spend some time reflecting on the emotions of others and exploring
        their experiences.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use your insight to support.</strong> Fours can make incredibly insightful friends and counselors. They
        have so much practice thinking about their own inner experience, that when they turn their focus outward, they
        can offer a level of understanding and depth that can be truly transformative for others. Practice using your
        skills for reflection and intuition to help others understand and gain perspective on their own experiences and
        issues.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Be of service.</strong> While Fours struggle with identity, Twos find belonging through service to
        others. Practice doing things for the benefit of others and looking for ways to help. Making a habit of taking
        care of others is an excellent way to counter the Four’s tendency to be self-absorbed.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>A Path Forward</h3>

<p>Like all types, Fours have patterns that they act out unconsciously, based on their own core beliefs and fears.
    Sometimes these patterns work for us; sometimes they hold us back. In recognizing our patterns and how they limit
    us, we can begin to grow beyond the limitations of our unconscious fears.</p>

<p>Although the Enneagram can be extremely useful in understanding who you are and why you do the things you do, the
    real value of the system is uncovered when you begin to understand it as a way to grow and develop. The Enneagram
    can help us to see our patterns objectively, so that we can begin to understand that they are not inevitable—we can
    choose to take another approach if we need to. And, it can help us to understand what we need to do in order to grow
    and become happier, more effective, more actualized people.</p>

<p>Each type has particular patterns they must examine and overcome in order to move forward. Fours must work on their
    ability to appreciate the present moment—what is real and actual. They must learn to rein in their emotional
    intensity when it does not serve them. And, they must start to think of themselves as connected to a larger whole,
    rather than believing themselves to be outsiders looking in.</p>

<p><strong>Growth tasks for Fours</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Recognize that your emotions are fleeting and changeable and are not always a reliable guide</li>
    <li>Focus on the present and what is positive about it</li>
    <li>Appreciate experiences that are pleasant, even if they are mundane</li>
    <li>Learn techniques to distract yourself from your emotions when they are becoming a burden or limitation to you
    </li>
    <li>Own your emotions as your own, valid experience, while recognizing that others may have different and equally
        valid experiences
    </li>
    <li>Develop an appreciation for the “good enough”</li>
</ul>

<p>When Fours are operating at their best, they are a powerful inspirational force. They keep the people around them
    tuned into the rich emotional experiences that life has to offer, and they encourage everyone they come into contact
    with to be themselves and express their unique take on things. Although it is never easy to examine and overcome our
    old patterns, Fours who do so will find that life can be even richer and more inspiring than they ever thought
    possible.</p>

<h2>What Makes You Unique</h2>
<p>Although your Enneagram type explains a great  deal about you, it doesn't explain everything! Within your type, you have reached a specific level of development and growth which is unique to you, and you have also had experiences that have required you to stretch into different modes and develop traits that are not necessarily typical for your Enneagram type. In this section, we'll look at the traits that are unique to you—both those traits that can be used as super-strengths, and those which may be holding you back.</p>
<p>Below, you'll find information on the top 3 traits you can harness as your personal superpowers, and the top 3 traits which may be stopping you from achieving what you desire. One important thing to remember is that personality traits are never all good, or all bad. Every trait has its possible benefits and potential downsides—it's all in how you use it. </p>
<h3>Your Top 3 Personality Superpowers</h3>
<p>Which of your personality traits are your biggest assets? We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and many psychologists believe that the key to success is not in trying to overcome all your flaws, but rather in making the most of what you have going for you. Let's look now at some traits that you may be able to deploy to your benefit.</p>
<p>As you read over this section, remember that even beneficial personality traits can work against you if they are overused. For each superpower below, you'll see how it can benefit your life, as well as how it may backfire if not kept in balance.</p></div>      <div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-strength_f test-result-dimension-strengths_result"><p></p><div class="uvcharts">

<p><strong>Emotional Awareness</strong>. Your emotional experience is deep and nuanced, and you are highly tuned in to what you are feeling. Where others may struggle with understanding their emotions, you are typically able to describe yours clearly and in detail. Sometimes your emotions may overwhelm you, but as long as you are conscious of keeping yourself in balance, your awareness of your feelings helps you experience life to the fullest. This emotional attuning may drive a creative process for you, or it may simply make you better able to connect with others and help them to tune into their own feelings. Either way, your  emotional landscape provides a rich backdrop for your life experience.</p></div><div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-strength_s test-result-dimension-strengths_result"><p></p><div class="uvcharts">

<p><strong>Individualism</strong>. You're not one to follow the herd, and you make decisions based on your own values and goals, not the expectations of other people. You think of yourself as unique and different from others, which can sometimes make you feel somewhat distant, but this attitude gives you original perspectives on things and makes you more likely to make choices that are right for you, instead of simply doing what's expected of you. </p></div><div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-strength_h test-result-dimension-strengths_result"><p></p><div class="uvcharts">

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>. You wouldn't dream of doing something without thinking it through, and you typically have a deeper understanding of the situation than the people around you—simply because you take the time to really think about it. While you may sometimes be accused of overthinking things (and in fact, you are prone to getting stuck in analysis when you should be taking action), for the most part, your thoughtfulness allows you to understand  more deeply, predict more accurately, and set more detailed goals. Rather than react too quickly, you  take time to ponder, with the result that your choices tend to be well thought-out and carefully considered.</p></div>      <div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-blindspot_intro_text test-result-dimension-blindspot_intro"><h3>Your Top 3 Personality Blindspots</h3>
<p>Now, let's take a look at those aspects of your personality that are likely to get in your way, cause you stress, or interfere with you achieving what you want. These are traits that you need to be especially conscious of, as they can tend to sidetrack you if you are not paying attention.</p>
<p>As with your strengths, these traits are not always negative; in fact, by being aware of them, you'll be more able to turn them to your advantage. The goal is not to eliminate these qualities from your personality; rather, you want to explore and master them so you can choose the most effective behavior for yourself in any given situation.</p></div>      <div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-blind_g test-result-dimension-blindspots_result"><p></p><div class="uvcharts">

<p><strong>Alienation. </strong>You feel separate from other people, and tend to think that others can't truly understand you. Most likely, you grew up around people—either family or social groups—who made you feel like an outsider. There's nothing wrong with appreciating yourself as a unique person, but everyone needs a sense of belonging. You'll live a fuller life if you put some time and energy into finding your "tribe." Somewhere out there are people who are just as offbeat as you are, and who will make you feel like you're finally understood.</p></div><div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-blind_c test-result-dimension-blindspots_result"><p></p><div class="uvcharts">

<p><strong>Image.</strong> You are very aware of what people think of you, and you cultivate your image with care. This means that you often make choices that others admire, and are often well-liked. However, it can also lead you to be overly concerned with appearances over substance—in the worst case scenario, leading a life that looks good from the outside but isn't fulfilling. Worse yet, your concern for image sometimes backfires, causing you to come off as inauthentic and creating distance in your relationships. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be admired, as long as you keep a sense of balance. Sometimes the right choice isn't the one that wins you the most acclaim, and sometimes you have to be willing to ruffle a few feathers as you pursue what's right for you.</p></div><div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-blind_l test-result-dimension-blindspots_result"><p></p><div class="uvcharts">

<p><strong>Pessimism. </strong>You may consider yourself realistic, not pessimistic, but the fact is that you often expect things to turn out poorly. While this means you're not usually disappointed—you never got your hopes up in the first place—it also means that you're hesitant to go out on a limb and try something that may not work out. You may miss out on valuable opportunities because you fail to think about the potential upside, and you may satisfy yourself with less-than-optimal circumstances because you don't imagine that there's a better alternative. Remember that most forward progress starts with a positive vision for the future. There's nothing wrong with being aware of the risks, but a balanced viewpoint takes into account the potential benefits as well. </p></div>      <div class="test-result-type-text test-result-category-final_text test-result-dimension-final_review"><p> </p>
